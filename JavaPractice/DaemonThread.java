// In Java, a daemon thread is a type of thread that runs in the background and performs tasks such as garbage collection or other maintenance activities. These threads are typically less important than user threads, as they provide auxiliary services and do not prevent the application from terminating. Here's a concise breakdown:

// Daemon Threads: Run in the background and are typically used for tasks that don't need to complete if the application ends.

// User Threads: Standard threads created by the application that perform actual tasks.

// You can create a daemon thread by calling the setDaemon(true) method on a Thread instance before you start it. Here's a quick example:

class MyDaemonThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        while (true) {
            System.out.println("Daemon thread running...");
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyDaemonThread daemonThread = new MyDaemonThread();
        daemonThread.setDaemon(true); // Set the thread as a daemon thread
        daemonThread.start();

        // Main thread sleeps for a while and then ends
        try {
            Thread.sleep(5000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("Main thread ending...");
    }
}
// In this example, the daemon thread will run indefinitely in the background, printing "Daemon thread running..." every second. 
// However, once the main thread finishes its sleep and ends, the JVM will exit, and the daemon thread will be terminated automatically.
