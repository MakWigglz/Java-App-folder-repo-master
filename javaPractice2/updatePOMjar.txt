your Maven project for the Economic Indicators application looks good, but there are a few improvements we can make to ensure it's set up perfectly. Let's go through the changes:
1.
Update the groupId to match your package structure.
2.
Add the maven-compiler-plugin to ensure the correct Java version is used.
3.
Add the maven-assembly-plugin to create an executable JAR with dependencies.
4.
Specify the main class for the executable JAR.

Changes and explanations:
1.
Updated groupId to com.github.MakWigglz to match your package structure.
2.
Added properties section to specify Java version and encoding.
3.
Updated the YahooFinanceAPI artifact ID to match the correct one on Maven Central.
4.
Added maven-compiler-plugin to ensure the correct Java version is used during compilation.
5.
Added maven-assembly-plugin to create an executable JAR with all dependencies included.
6.
Specified the main class com.github.MakWigglz.economicIndicators.StockDataJava for the executable JAR.
With these changes, your Maven project is now set up perfectly. You can build your project using:
mvn clean package
This will create two JAR files in the target directory:
1.
economicIndicators-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar (without dependencies)
2.
economicIndicators-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar (with all dependencies included)
You can run your application using:
java -jar target/economicIndicators-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
This setup ensures that your project is properly configured, easily buildable, and executable with all dependencies included.
