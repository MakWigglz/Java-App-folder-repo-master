Package Declaration: package com.example.demo; - This line declares the package for the class. It's a way to organize classes in Java.
Imports: 
SpringApplication and SpringBootApplication are part of the Spring Boot framework. They are used to bootstrap and launch a Spring application from a Java main method.
`@SpringBootApplication` Annotation: This is a convenience annotation that adds:
@Configuration: Tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.
@EnableAutoConfiguration: Tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings.
@ComponentScan: Tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the com/example/demo package, allowing it to find the HelloController.
Main Method: 
public static void main(String[] args): This is the entry point of the Java application.
SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);: This line launches the Spring Boot application.
-------------------------------------------
Package Declaration: package com.example.demo.controller; - This organizes the class within the controller subpackage.
Imports: 
GetMapping and RestController are part of the Spring Web module. They are used to create RESTful web services.
`@RestController` Annotation: This is a specialized version of the @Controller annotation. It is used to create RESTful web services using Spring MVC. It combines @Controller and @ResponseBody, eliminating the need to annotate each method with @ResponseBody.
`@GetMapping("/hello")` Annotation: This maps HTTP GET requests to the sayHello method. When a GET request is made to /hello, this method is invoked.
`sayHello` Method: 
public String sayHello(): This method returns a String response.
return "Hello, World!";: This line returns the string "Hello, World!" as the response body.


Summary
The DemoApplication class is the entry point of the Spring Boot application.
The HelloController class defines a REST endpoint /hello that responds with "Hello, World!" when accessed via an HTTP GET request.
The application is structured using Spring Boot's annotations to simplify configuration and setup.
Let's address your questions one by one:

### What are Bean Definitions?

In the context of Spring, a "bean" is an object that is managed by the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container. Bean definitions are essentially the configuration metadata that tells the Spring container how to instantiate, configure, and assemble the objects in your application.

- **Bean Definition**: It includes information such as the class type of the bean, the scope of the bean (singleton, prototype, etc.), any initialization or destruction methods, and any dependencies that need to be injected into the bean.

- **Configuration**: Beans can be defined in several ways, including XML configuration files, Java annotations, or Java-based configuration classes. The Spring container uses these definitions to manage the lifecycle and dependencies of the beans.

### What is the Spring Boot Framework?

Spring Boot is an extension of the Spring framework that simplifies the process of setting up and developing new Spring applications. It provides a set of tools and conventions to make it easier to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.

- **Auto-Configuration**: Spring Boot can automatically configure your application based on the dependencies present on the classpath. This reduces the need for manual configuration.

- **Embedded Servers**: Spring Boot applications can run on embedded servers like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow, which means you don't need to deploy your application to an external server.

- **Convention over Configuration**: Spring Boot follows a "convention over configuration" approach, which means it provides sensible defaults for many configuration settings, allowing developers to focus on writing business logic rather than boilerplate code.

- **Starter Dependencies**: Spring Boot provides a set of "starter" dependencies that simplify the process of adding common dependencies to your project. For example, `spring-boot-starter-web` includes everything you need to build a web application.

- **Production-Ready Features**: Spring Boot includes features like health checks, metrics, and externalized configuration to help you build production-ready applications.

Overall, Spring Boot is designed to make it easier to get started with Spring and to streamline the development process by reducing the amount of configuration and setup required.
Certainly! The `public static void main(String[] args)` method is a special method in Java that serves as the entry point for any standalone Java application. Let's break down each part of this method signature:

- **public**: This is an access modifier, which means that the method is accessible from anywhere. It must be `public` so that the Java runtime can access it when the program starts.

- **static**: This keyword means that the method belongs to the class, rather than an instance of the class. This allows the Java runtime to call this method without having to create an instance of the class.

- **void**: This indicates that the method does not return any value. The `main` method is not expected to return anything to the Java runtime.

- **main**: This is the name of the method. The Java runtime looks for this specific method name as the starting point of the application.

- **String[] args**: This is an array of `String` objects. It allows the program to accept command-line arguments. When you run a Java program, you can pass additional arguments to the `main` method, which can be accessed through this `args` array.

In summary, the `public static void main(String[] args)` method is the standard way to define the entry point of a Java application. It allows the program to be executed and optionally receive input from the command line.
Let's explore the concepts of a class and an instance in Java:

### What is a Class?

A class in Java is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines a data structure by encapsulating data (fields or attributes) and methods (functions or procedures) that operate on the data. A class can be thought of as a user-defined data type.

- **Fields**: These are variables that hold the state or attributes of the class.
- **Methods**: These are functions that define the behavior of the class. They can manipulate the fields and perform operations.

For example, consider a simple class definition:

```java
public class Car {
    // Fields
    private String color;
    private String model;

    // Constructor
    public Car(String color, String model) {
        this.color = color;
        this.model = model;
    }

    // Method
    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Car model: " + model + ", Color: " + color);
    }
}
```

### What is an Instance of a Class?

An instance of a class is an actual object created from the class blueprint. When you create an instance, you allocate memory for the object and initialize its fields. Each instance has its own set of fields and can interact with other instances independently.

- **Creating an Instance**: You use the `new` keyword followed by the class constructor to create an instance.

For example, using the `Car` class defined above:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an instance of the Car class
        Car myCar = new Car("Red", "Toyota");

        // Accessing the method of the instance
        myCar.displayInfo(); // Output: Car model: Toyota, Color: Red
    }
}
```

In this example:
- `Car` is the class.
- `myCar` is an instance of the `Car` class. It represents a specific car with its own `color` and `model` attributes.

In summary, a class is a blueprint for creating objects, and an instance is a specific object created from that blueprint. Each instance has its own state and behavior as defined by the class.
